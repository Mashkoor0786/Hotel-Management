                            <p>Keyless Entry functionality is available at participating hotels to guests who have downloaded our RED App, who have a valid reservation for a single guest room, and who have elected to use Keyless Entry. Valid reservations may not include certain reservations made through meeting planners, travel agents, wholesalers, and third-party websites.</p>
    <p>In order to use Keyless Entry you must ensure that all necessary settings and required network communications are enabled and correct, including, without limitation, allowing and enabling push notifications to be sent to your mobile device. In addition, you acknowledge and agree that Keyless Entry can only be used when Bluetooth functionality is enabled on your mobile device and that mobile keys can only be issued to or deleted from the RED App when your mobile device has network connectivity. If your mobile device does not have network connectivity at any time, you will only be able to use valid mobile keys already installed in the RED App.</p>
    <p>Mobile keys licensed to you are specific to your mobile device and you will have to re-download the RED App and re-register for Keyless Entry if you get a new mobile device.</p>
    <p>If Keyless Entry is available to you, you acknowledge and agree that your guest room number for a valid reservation will be sent to your mobile device through the RED App and will be viewable to anyone with access to your mobile device through the RED App. You are solely responsible for restricting use of the RED App on your mobile device and keeping your mobile device secure—for example, by using passwords or other security functions necessary to restrict access to your mobile device or the RED App. You agree that you will not allow a third party to use your mobile device to access the RED App or use Keyless Entry on your mobile device.</p>
    <p>If at any time while you have a reservation that can be accessed via Keyless Entry your mobile device is lost, stolen, or hacked, you agree to immediately contact the front desk of the hotel where the reservation was made and to follow any instructions that the hotel or that Radisson Hospitality provides, including, without limitation, deleting or consenting to the deletion of any mobile keys from your mobile device). Neither Radisson Hospitality nor any participating property will be responsible for any problems or claims that may result from your failure to adequately secure your device or to notify the applicable hotel in the event that your mobile device is lost, stolen, or hacked or is otherwise no longer in your possession or control or is compromised.</p>
    <p>You agree that you will only use Keyless Entry in connection with a valid reservation for the intended purposes of checking-in and of using your mobile device to access designated areas that you are lawfully permitted to access, including the guest room assigned to you. You shall not use Keyless Entry for any other purpose and you may only use Keyless Entry on a mobile device that you control.</p>
    <p>Copyright and patent laws and international treaty provisions protect Keyless Entry software and mobile keys. Any reproduction or redistribution of the software or mobile keys is expressly prohibited by law and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Without limiting the foregoing, copying or reproduction of the software or mobile keys for further reproduction or redistribution is expressly prohibited. Radisson Hospitality grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use Keyless Entry functionality on your mobile device while it is in your possession and under your control and only for use as otherwise set forth in these terms.</p></div>
